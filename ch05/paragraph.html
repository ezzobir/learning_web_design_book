        Serif typefaces have small slabs at the ends of letter strokes. In  general, serif fonts can make large amounts of text easier to  read.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Sans-serif fonts do not have serif slabs; their strokes are square  on the end. Helvetica and Arial are examples of sans-serif fonts.  In general, sans-serif fonts appear sleeker and more modern.
