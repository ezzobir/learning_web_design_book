Tapenade (Olive Spread)
</p>
<p>
This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at<br>
parties. My father recommends:
</p>
<p>
"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just<br>
bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try<br>
serving it warm."
</p>
<p>
Ingredients
</p>
<p>
1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes<br>
2 large garlic cloves<br>
2/3 c. kalamata olives<br>
1 t. capers
</p>
<p>
Instructions
</p>
<p>
Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth <br>
as possible.
</p>
<p>
Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are<br>
incorporated, but still retain some<br>
texture.
</p>
<p>
Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).
